### Explanation
Devise, then code in python 3, a efficient algorithm for the following
problem. Inputs: (i) a connected weighted undirected graph G = hV, Ei, and, (ii) an edge
e âˆˆ E. Output: true if there is a minimum spanning tree of G that contains e, and false
otherwise. G is provided in adjacency list format, and e as a list which encodes a pair.
E.g., an encoding of the following graph is [[[3,10], [1,100], [2, 20]], [[0,100]],
1[[0,20],[3,10]], [[2,10],[0,10]]], and the output is false for edge [2,0] and true for
edge [0,1].
