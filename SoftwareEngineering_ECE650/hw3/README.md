This was a harsh assignment. \
I needed to figure out;\
* How many different executables are required beside the explicitly explained ones in the assignment handoud
* How to pipe them.
### Explanation
* Modify the output format of your Python script from Assignment 1 to match the input format
of your C++ program from Assignment 2.
* Modify your C++ program from Assignment 2 to output the input graph on standard output.
* Write a program in C++ to generate random input for your Python script.
* Write a driver program in C++ that uses Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to link the
output of the random input generator to the input of the Python script, and the output of the
Python script to the input of the C++ program from Assignment 2. \
