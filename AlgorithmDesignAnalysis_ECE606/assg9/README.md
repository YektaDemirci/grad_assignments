### Explanation
Hamiltonian path in an undirected graph is a simple path of all its
vertices. Given input an undirected graph, devise and code a Python 3 program that returns
such a path as a list, or an empty list if no such path exists. The input graph is provided
to you as a list of lists of neighbours of each vertex, with the vertices assumed to be named
0, 1, . . . , |V |âˆ’1. For example, the following graph is encoded as [[1,2,3],[0],[3,0],[0,2]].
This graph has a Hamiltonian path, and so the return value should be one of those paths.
