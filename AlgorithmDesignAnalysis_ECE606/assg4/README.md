### Explanation
First design, then implement in Python 3, an efficient algorithm that,
given input a directed graph G = hV, E, wi, returns the vertices of a negative-weight cycle in
order as a list, if one exists, and an empty list otherwise. The vertices in the input graph are
named 0, 1, . . . , |V | âˆ’ 1, and G is provided as a list of lists of hneighbour, weighti pairs.
