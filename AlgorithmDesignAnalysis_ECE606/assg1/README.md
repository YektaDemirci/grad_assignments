### Explanation
Write a python function avgfalsepos that takes three arguments: (i) n ∈ N which
is the size of U, (ii) k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, which is the size of S, and, (iii) m ∈ N which is 1the size of the array B[·]. The function should compute and return a real number of the average number of false positives for a Bloom filter across 100 uniform choices for the random function f : U → {0, 1, . . . , m − 1}.
