# Explanation
## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to implement the Go-Back-N protocol, which could be used to transfer a text file from one host to another across an unreliable network. The protocol should be able to handle network errors, such as packet loss and duplicate packets. \
You will write two programs: a sender and a
receiver.
## Executables and inputs
There are two executables sender and receiver. The command line inputs should be given as it is explained in assigment2 handout. It is assumed inputs are given in the correct order.
## Outputs
There should be an output file generated with the given name as <name>.txt also, ack.log, seqnum.log and arrival.log as it is explained in the handout. Also rather than sending no ACK, ACK31 is initialized at the receiver side.
## The machines used for test
'ubuntu1804-004' and 'ubuntu1804-008' were used to test the code.
